            Hick's law is so important to keep in mind when
            building mobile-friendly websites. The law states that
            less is more when it comes to features and content on
            a website. For example, instead of having a single
            web page that has all the content for your entire site, it is 
            best practice to divide your website into multiple
            web pages with related content.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a mobile site, this is even more true. It is even alright
            to remove features on a mobile-sized screen if keeping then
            would inhibit the user's experience by cramming too many
            things on such a small screen. Apple does a good job on their
            home page: there are only 3 things (other than the menu bar)
            that you can click on, and only 1 main image when you first
            enter their site. This looks good, and at the same time,
            the user can do everything they want to whe they normally
            visit the Apple website: learn more about a new phone,
            or buy one.

              It is very important to implement good decision-making 
              skills when you want to use white space in your website.
              In order to be appealing to the eye, most websites should
              not fill the entire viewing area with color. White space is
              the key to getting a professional yet visibly pleasing effect
              for any of the users of your website. However, there are 
              definitely ways to get too much white space.
            </p>
             <p>
              When it comes to white space and clean design like Zillow's mobile site, you need to
              be simple but not too simple. Images and colors should tie
              into the whitespace that you use. If you do choose to have 
              a lot of white space, but you don't have enough visual 
              content to pair with it, then your site might look too 
              bare. At the same time, if you choose to implement too little
              white space, the website may be visually detracting and 
              distracting to the site's intended purpose for the user. There 
              is a fine balance, but getting it right will really help 
              produce a clean design.

        Rule of Thirds

              There is a rule called the "Rule of Thirds" that is 
              meant to be a guide of displaying content in order 
              to achieve a pleasing viewing experience for the user.
              This rule especially applies to websites on the desktop 
              and mobile levels. In order for people to want to engage
              with your site, you need to follow this rule in order to do 
              so. It will really help!
              </p>
              <p>
              Amazon's mobile site is a good example of the Rule of
              Thirds. They really do divide their mobile site into
              a grid of nine seperate rectangles and place certain 
              content in each of the places that the eye tends to "track", 
              or follow. For example, the eye usually begins in the upper-left 
              portion of the viewing area. Right at these coordinates is the 
              brand logo for another product that is similar to the one 
              on the current page. If you know where people are going to 
              look on your website, it is extremely helpful to know where 
              to place content in order to fulfull the purpose of your site.
